            Around 00:30 I and the other students returned to the bus to continue our journey to Semarang. Just before dawn, to be precise, around 02:30 the bus arrived at RM. Kurnia Jatim, there the students changed clothes into typical uniforms. I went to the bathroom to shower and change into my typical uniform. After showering, I and the other students then prayed the morning prayer, then waited for breakfast. At 06:00 all the students had breakfast. After breakfast, all the students returned to their respective buses to travel to MTs Ar-Rois Scholar Semarang for a visit. There the students had a look at the Madrasah. I visited the men's dormitory, even though it wasn't finished yet and the madrasa was still new, the facilities were quite good. Equipped with a futsal field, prayer room and others. Next, all the students returned to their buses each to continue their journey to Lawang Sewu. At around 11:30 the bus arrived at Lawang Sewu. The other students and I entered Lawang Sewu and looked at the building. There are several historical relics there such as trains and so on. I explored Lawang Sewu while taking photos of the surrounding environment. And I wanted to buy clothes but didn't because I wanted to buy clothes in Malioboro. Also following were friends buying drinks and class 8A gathering for a class photo. Then I headed to the bus to go to the Mosque of Semarang to perform the Jama' and Qasr prayers. While on the bus, my friends and I were given boxed rice for lunch, my friends and I had lunch. At 15:00 the bus arrives at the Grand Mosque of Semarang. My friends and I went to the mosque and took ablution, while waiting for the students and teachers, I chatted with my friends. And a few minutes later I and the others performed the Jama' Qashar Dhuhur Asr prayer. And after praying I returned to the bus to continue the journey to Semilir Village. At around 15:30 the bus arrived at Semilir Village. My friends and I explored the place. Because of the rain, the roads are a bit slippery and you have to be careful. It was quite exciting there. I also had time to play on the Haunted House ride. And at 18:00 I returned to the bus and went on a journey. After arriving at the hotel, my roommate and I took the key and got a room on the 5th floor. Then took the elevator and arrived at my and my friends' room. After that, all my friends, including me, put their bags or suitcases inside. And also don't forget to shower. And this time was free time so my friends and I played on our cellphones for a while then went to sleep.

            My friend woke me up to do morning prayers together in our respective rooms. After the prayer, my friends and I took turns showering. After that, my roommate and I left the room to meet friends in another room. And after that all my friends headed downstairs for breakfast at the hotel. After breakfast I prepared the bag I brought for the next trip. I went straight to the bus, and then the bus will go to the souvenir place. I bought 3 Bakpia, each containing 15 Bakpia. Not long after, I returned to the bus and the bus continued its journey to Borobudur Temple. About 2-3 hours later the bus arrived at Borobudur Temple. After coming down, many people were selling goods or food and offering them. I arrived at the temple and was guided and given information about the temple which is 35 meters high. And also go around until you get to the place in the picture below. In this place, each class will sing the chants made the previous day. And class 8A was the first, I and all the 8A students sang chants. After singing the chants, 8A students and their homeroom teachers took photos together and got to know foreign tourists. Then the journey to the bus passes the Borobudur Temple Museum and arrives at the starting point of the bus and gets on the bus. Continue the journey for lunch at RM. Progosari. Because I arrived early, it didn't take long to wait in line and after eating my friends and I returned to the bus to wait for the other students to eat. After all the students had lunch, all the buses continued their journey to the grave of Kyai Raden Santri Gunung Pring to make a pilgrimage and perform Jama' Qashar Dhuhur & Asr prayers. After prayer, all students return to the bus. And the next agenda is a lava tour. The lava tour is like riding a jeep and going through watery roads. And this time is quite exciting, and also coincides with the rainy season, adding to the excitement. I and all the students wore raincoats. I and 4 of my friends boarded a jeep. The jeep started and I took the front position next to the driver. The jeep also arrived near the Museum of My Remains of Treasure, the remains of the people's belongings there as a result of the eruption of Mount Merapi. And the Jeep continued the journey, this time I was at the back, around Maghrib time, the jeep arrived at the bus, and I wanted to change clothes in the bathroom there. After changing clothes, I returned to the bus and continued my journey to RM. Joglo Asri, and also the Qashar Maghrib Isha prayer at the Joglo Asri Mosque. And the next agenda was supposed to be Malioboro, but it was canceled for tomorrow because it was already late and the students were tired. And the bus went to the hotel and when I arrived at the hotel I went to sleep.
